# Pizza menu - the static React project

Working with components, props and JSX
[Project link]() - coming soon

## What have I learned?

[Components](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_components.asp#:~:text=Components%20are%20independent%20and%20reusable,will%20concentrate%20on%20Function%20components.) - are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

React components use [props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) to communicate with each other.Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props.

[JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.
