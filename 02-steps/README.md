[Project link]() - coming soon

## What have I learned?

The [state](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_state.asp) object is where you store property values that belong to the component

Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user [events](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_events.asp).
